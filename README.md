[📖 Template Usage Guide](./TEMPLATE_USAGE.md)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **CSS**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## 🧠 AI-First Workflow
This repository is optimized for AI pair-programming. It includes a custom AI Agent structure:

### AI Skills (`.agent/skills/`)
Each directory in `.agent/skills/` contains a specialized "skill" that the AI uses to solve complex problems:
- `ui-ux-pro-max`: Advanced design intelligence and consistency rules.
- `superpowers/`: Specialized engineering workflows (TDD, Debugging, etc.).
- `template/`: Use this as a base to create new AI skills.

### How to use with AI
When working with an AI assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), it will automatically pick up the rules in `.cursorrules` and `GEMINI.md` to guide its behavior.

## 🛠 Getting Started
1. Configure your project in `saas.config.ts`.
2. Set up your Supabase environment variables.
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

## 📜 Philosophy
- **Vibe over boilerplate**: Skip the setup, focus on the feel.
- **Premium default**: Everything looks expensive right out of the box.
- **Modularity**: Small files, clear interfaces, no magic.
