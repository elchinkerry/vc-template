# 🌍 IZI SAAS KIT GLOBAL PROTOCOLS

These rules apply to all development activities within the Vibe Kit ecosystem.

## 1. YC Vibe-Coding (Plan First)
- **Never jump into code** without a plan.
- Create `/brain/<id>/implementation_plan.md` first.
- Ask for user approval (LGTM) before implementation.

## 2. Incremental Development
- Build modules one by one.
- Each iteration must have:
  - Clear goal.
  - List of modified files.
  - Precise steps.
  - "Click-checklist" for manual verification.

## 3. Git Discipline
- Commit after every working module.
- If the AI or the dev gets stuck in a loop → **REVERT** (`git reset --hard HEAD`).
- Clean implementation over layered hacks.

## 4. Engineering Standards
- **Small Files**: Modularity is key. No 800-line components.
- **Safety**: Supabase RLS must be enabled for all user tables.
- **Visuals**: If it doesn't look "premium", it's a bug. Use Tailwind v4 features.

## 5. Verification
- Always run the dev server (`npm run dev`) to check for runtime errors.
- Check terminal output for warnings/errors before declaring success.
- Proactively fix issues found during verification.
